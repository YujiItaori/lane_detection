## 🛡️ Safety & Limitations

### **⚠️ Important Safety Notice**
This is a **demonstration project** and should **NOT** be used directly in safety-critical applications without extensive additional development, testing, and validation. For production use in vehicles or robots:

- Implement redundant detection systems
- Add fail-safe mechanisms and emergency protocols
- Conduct thorough testing under all operating conditions
- Comply with automotive/robotics safety standards (ISO 26262, etc.)
- Include human oversight and intervention capabilities

### Current Limitations
- **Weather Sensitivity**: Performance may degrade in heavy rain, snow, or fog
- **Road Marking Quality**: Requires visible lane markings (worn markings may not be detected)
- **Construction Zones**: May struggle with temporary or non-standard markings
- **Lighting Extremes**: Very bright sunlight or complete darkness may affect accuracy

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**❌ No Lines Detected**
→ Check if lane markings are visible and adjust color thresholds

**❌ Flickering in Videos**
→ Increase temporal smoothing parameters (alpha value)

**❌ False Detections**
→ Adjust ROI parameters to focus on relevant road areas

**❌ Poor Performance in Low Light**
→ Use specialized night vision processing parameters
